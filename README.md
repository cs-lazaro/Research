# Hello

My name is Albert and I am a young finance graduate working towards a career in finance. 

I am interested in equity research, so whenever I am curious about a certain stock I try to value it.
Here you will find the stock I am currently working on (unfinished unless there is a "Report" file).

# Current Project
This fall, I was curious about *The We Company*, especially after its failed IPO and bail out; so **I am valuing *We Work*** (the group's most famous subsidiary).
The rapidly increasing flow of news surrounding the company changes the valuation as more information becomes available, so this is still a working project.
